# Offensive Security
# PNPT OSCP

#Welcome to all

These files are my notes compiled with the aim of later creating my own attack framework.

You can find all the steps in the Cyber Kill Chain

From OSINT to Post-Exploit Persistence.

You'll find scripts in python, php and bash.
as well as Tryhackme and PNTP courses.

These notes will help me prepare for OSCP.

I'm adding new content almost every day, taking my time, the goal being to understand what I'm doing and master it, not to get a diploma congratulating me for following the "guidelines" without digging deeper.
