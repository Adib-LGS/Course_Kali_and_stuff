LDAP

Another method of AD authentication that applications can use is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication. 
LDAP authentication is similar to NTLM authentication. However, with LDAP authentication, the application directly verifies the user's credentials. 

The application has a pair of AD credentials that it can use first to query LDAP and then verify the AD user's credentials.

LDAP authentication is a popular mechanism with third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD. 
These include applications and systems such as:

Gitlab
Jenkins
Custom-developed web applications
Printers
VPNs

If any of these applications or services are exposed on the internet, the same type of attacks as those leveraged against NTLM authenticated systems can be used. 
However, since a service using LDAP authentication requires a set of AD credentials, it opens up additional attack avenues. 
In essence, we can attempt to recover the AD credentials used by the service to gain authenticated access to AD.

If you could gain a foothold on the correct host, such as a Gitlab server, it might be as simple as reading the configuration files to recover these AD credentials. 
These credentials are often stored in plain text in configuration files since the security model relies on keeping the location and storage configuration file secure rather than its contents.

(1) User sends printing requests
with AD username and password

(2) Printer uses its AD credential
to create and LDAP bind request

(3) DC provides bind response

(4) Printer requests LDAP User search

(5) User search response

(6) LDAP Bind request with user credentials

(7) Server sends Bind response

(8) User is authenticatedand print job is accepted
