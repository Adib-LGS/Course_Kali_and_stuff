Token Impersonation:
    is a Windows post-exploitation technique that allows an attacker to steal the access token of a logged-on user on the system without knowing their credentials 
    and impersonate them to perform operations with their privileges.

    This technique is effective for lateral movement and privilege escalation; 
    an attacker can obtain domain admin privileges if a logged-on user is a domain administrator. 
    They can also use the impersonated tokens to pivot to other domain machines on the network. 
    The impersonation technique requires the attacker to gain local admin privileges on the compromised machine to steal its tokens.

Impersonation Privileges:
    whoami /priv:
        SeImpersonatePrivilege  -- Enable  is == SeAssignPrimaryToken
