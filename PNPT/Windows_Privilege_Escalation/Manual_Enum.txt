Operating System:

    What is the OS and architecture? Is it missing any patches?

        systeminfo
        wmic qfe

    Is there anything interesting in environment variables? A domain controller in LOGONSERVER?

        set

        Get-ChildItem Env: | ft Key,Value

    Are there any other connected drives?

        net use
        wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,providername

        Get-PSDrive | where {$_.Provider -like "Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem"}| ft Name,Root

Users:

    whoami

    whoami /priv 

    net users: 
        User accounts for \\WIN-QBA94KB3IOF

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        admin                    Administrator            DefaultAccount           
        Guest                    user                     WDAGUtilityAccount   


    net localgroup: <--- Wich group

        Aliases for \\WIN-QBA94KB3IOF


    net localgroup Administrators <---Are any of the users in the Administrators group?


    Anything in the Registry for User Autologon?
        reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon" 2>nul | findstr "DefaultUserName DefaultDomainName DefaultPassword"

    Anything interesting in Credential Manager?
        cmdkey /list

Programs, Processes, and Services:

    Are there any weak folder or file permissions?

    Full Permissions for Everyone or Users on Program Folders?

        icacls "C:\Program Files\*" 2>nul | findstr "(F)" | findstr "Everyone"
        icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\*" 2>nul | findstr "(F)" | findstr "Everyone"

        icacls "C:\Program Files\*" 2>nul | findstr "(F)" | findstr "BUILTIN\Users"
        icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\*" 2>nul | findstr "(F)" | findstr "BUILTIN\Users" 

    Modify Permissions for Everyone or Users on Program Folders?

        icacls "C:\Program Files\*" 2>nul | findstr "(M)" | findstr "Everyone"
        icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\*" 2>nul | findstr "(M)" | findstr "Everyone"

        icacls "C:\Program Files\*" 2>nul | findstr "(M)" | findstr "BUILTIN\Users" 
        icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\*" 2>nul | findstr "(M)" | findstr "BUILTIN\Users" 


    You can also upload accesschk from Sysinternals to check for writeable folders and files.

        accesschk.exe -qwsu "Everyone" *
        accesschk.exe -qwsu "Authenticated Users" *
        accesschk.exe -qwsu "Users" *

    What are the running processes/services on the system? Is there an inside service not exposed? If so, can we open it? See Port Forwarding in Appendix.

        tasklist /svc
        tasklist /v
        net start
        sc query
