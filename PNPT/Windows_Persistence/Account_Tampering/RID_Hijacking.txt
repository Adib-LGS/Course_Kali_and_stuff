RID Hijacking

Another method to gain administrative privileges without being an administrator is:
    Changing some registry values to make the operating system think you are the Administrator.

When a user is created, an identifier called Relative ID (RID) is assigned to them.
When a user logs on, the LSASS process gets its RID from the SAM registry hive and creates an access token associated with that RID

The goal is: Associating the same RID to both accounts (Admin & Created account)

    -Admin RID = 500
    -Regular users RID >= 1000

To find the assigned RIDs in Windows cmd:
    -wmic useraccount get name, sid

We only have to assign the RID=500 to the wanted ACCOUNT. 
    To do so, we need to access the SAM using Regedit. 
    The SAM is restricted to the SYSTEM account only, so even the Administrator won't be able to edit it. 
    To run Regedit as SYSTEM, we will use "psexec" mainly here:
        PAth: C:\tools\pstools
        -PsExec64.exe -i -s regedit

From Regedit, we will go to:
    HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\

    want to modify thmuser3:
        we need to search for a key with its RID in hex (1010 = 0x3F2)
            ->F
            ->We will now replace those two bytes with the RID of Administrator in hex (500 = 0x01F4), 
            switching around the bytes (F401)
