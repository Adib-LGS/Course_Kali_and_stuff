################################
Mirai demonstrates one of the fastest-growing attack vectors in modern times; improperly configured IoT devices.
This attack vector is constantly on the rise as more and more IoT devices are being created and deployed around the globe,
and is actively being exploited by a wide variety of botnets.
Internal IoT devices are also being used for long-term persistence by malicious actors.

    Port 80:   
        We use dirbuster:
            http://10.10.10.48/admin:
                App Name: Pi-hole Version v3.1.4
                Web Server : lighttpd 1.4.35

                Forgot password:
                After installing Pi-hole for the first time, a password is generated and displayed to the user. The password cannot be retrieved later on, but it is possible to set a new password (or explicitly disable the password by setting an empty password) using the command

                sudo pihole -a -p

            http://10.10.10.48/versions:
                upload versions - 1713286211,,,
                data tables 1.10.12


            It is a Raspberry pi version we will use the default passwords:
                Raspberry
                Access your account by using the default username “pi” and the default password “raspberry”

 

    Port 22:
        We will try to ssh with default creds:
            ssh pi@10.10.10.48

        Bingo, we have an SSH Shell

 


2-Exploit:
    Linux Priv Esc:
        find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

        we found pkexec:
            sudo pkexec /bin/sh



    We are Root but the user lost the root flag file:       
        df -h <-- list of the machine’s partitions

        sudo strings /dev/sdb:
            display all finds in lost+founds



    Method 2 - Imaging and Recovery

        The command sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb of=/home/pi/usb.dd will create an image of the USB stick
        and save it to the pi user’s home directory. From there, the file can be exfiltrated many ways. In
        this case, a simple SCP from the attacking machine will suffice. 
        
        The following command copies:
        usb.dd to the local machine’s working directory: scp pi@10.10.10.48:/home/pi/usb.dd .

        With the USB image at hand, it is possible to run a large range of tools against it to extract the
        data.
        
        Unfortunately, in this case, the data between the filename and the contents of the file itself
        has been overwritten, so recovery with most tools is not possible. A quick check with testdisk
        shows the file with a size of 0.
