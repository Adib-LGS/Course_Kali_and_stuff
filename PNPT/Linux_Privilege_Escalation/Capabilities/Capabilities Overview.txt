Difference between capability and SUID:

SUID: 
SUID stands for set user ID and allows users to execute the file as the file owner. 
This is defined as giving temporary access to a user to run a program/file with the permissions of the file’s owner rather than the user who runs it. 
This can easily be detected by the use of the “Find” command. 
To find all files with SUID set in the current directory we can use-perm option which will print files only with permissions set to 4000.


Capability: 
Security of Linux systems can be improved by using many actions. 
One of these measures is called Linux capabilities which are maintained by the kernel. 
In other words, we can say that they are a little unintelligible but similar in principle to SUID. 
Linux’s thread privilege checking is based on capabilities.
