Powershell History:
If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, 
it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a cmd.exe prompt:

-type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

If NOT in cmd.exe:
-type $Env:userprofile\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

Saved Windows Credentials:
list saved credentials:
-cmdkey /list 
-runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe

IIS Configuration:
Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. 
The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called web.config and can store 
passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. 

Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find web.config in one of the following locations:

-C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
-C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:
-type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

Retrieve Credentials from PuTTY:
PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, 
it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.


To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword 
with the following command:
-reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
