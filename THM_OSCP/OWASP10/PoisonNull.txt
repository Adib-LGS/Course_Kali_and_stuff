 Try to download "package.json.bak." :

    It seems we are met with a "403" which says that only ".md and .pdf" files can be downloaded. 

    We will use a character bypass called "Poison Null Byte". 
    A Poison Null Byte looks like this: %00. 

Note: as we can download it using the url, we will need to encode this into a url encoded format.

    The Poison Null Byte will now look like this: %2500. 
    Adding this and then a .md to the end will bypass the 403 error!

Why does this work? 

    A Poison Null Byte is actually a NULL terminator. B
    y placing a NULL character in the string at a certain byte, the string will tell the server to terminate at that point, 
    nulling the rest of the string.
