#nmap - Port scanning switches:
    -sS == Syn Scan Half Open -> SYN send and RST after receive the SYN/ACK from the target == Fast + Stealth

    -sT == TCP 3Way/HandShake
        if flag == RST:
            port is closed
        elif flag == SYN but receive NO RESPONSE:
            port could be FILTERED by a FW

    -sU == UPD Scan but too long not reliable
        Su is slow == True:
            nmap -sU --top-ports 20 TargetIP
            this is a good practice because nmap have to double check each ping packet to make sure if the port is closed
            by default nmap -sU mark the packet as "open|filtered"

    if nmap is running in sudo:
        default scan mode is -sS
    else:
        default scan mode is -sT

FIRE WALL EVASION:
    -sX == Xmas send a MALFORDMED TCP packet and expects a RST RESPONSE for CLOSED PORTS (PSH,URG,FIN)
            Microsoft Windows + Cisco devices are known to respond with a RST to any MALFORMED TCP packet
