1)Installation:

After installed and activated the Burp Suite Proxy for firefox and then configured it.

We can launch a new REQUEST HHTP GET by trying to connect to a web site via the Browser

If the configuration was correcte we are now able to HOLD the REQUEST on BURP SUITE thgrough our loopback socket IP+Port

As of now we can forward, modify or delete the REQUEST

The log are captured in Burp Suite:
    ->Proxy
        ->HTTP History and WebSockets History

To modify the RESPONSE to the REQUEST GET:
    ->Proxy
        ->Intercept
            ->Action 
                ->Do Intercept -> Response to this request

Otherwise It is possible to use to integrated Web Brower of Burp Suite

We can RESTRICT BURP to ONLY target our wanted web app:
    ->Target
        ->R-click on the wanted URL
            ->Add to scope

To specifiy the intercepting scope of the Proxy:
    ->Proxy
        ->Proxy Settings
            ->REQUEST INTERCEPTION RULES
                ->AND URL In Target scope
