Escalate our privileges and become the superuser (root) :

    ->In Linux, SUID (set owner userId upon execution) is a particular type of file permission given to a file. 
    SUID gives temporary permissions to a user to run the program/file 
    with the permission of the file owner (rather than the user who runs it).

    ->For example, the binary file to change your password has the SUID bit set on it (/usr/bin/passwd). 
    This is because to change your password; it will need to write to the shadowers file that you do not have access to, root does; 
    so it has root privileges to make the right changes.

    Need to find "/bin/systemctl" file
