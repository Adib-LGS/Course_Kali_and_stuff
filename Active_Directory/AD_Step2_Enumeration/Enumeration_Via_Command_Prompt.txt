Enumeration through Command Prompt:
Defenders are monitoring for PowerShell use, and you need to perform your AD Enumeration through a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). 

CMD has a built-in command that we can use to enumerate information about AD:
    net -> The net command is a handy tool to enumerate information about the local system and AD


##################
Users:
    We can use the net command to list all users in the AD domain by using the user sub-option:
        C:\>net user /domain

    We can also use this sub-option to enumerate more detailed information about a single user account:
        net user zoe.marshall /domain

Groups:
    We can use the net command to enumerate the groups of the domain by using the group sub-option:
        C:\>net group /domain

    We could also enumerate more details such as membership to a group by specifying the group in the same command:
        net group "Tier 1 Admins" /domain

Password Policy:
    We can use the net command to enumerate the password policy of the domain by using the accounts sub-option:
        C:\>net accounts /domain

    This will provide us with helpful information such as:
        ->Length of password history kept. Meaning how many unique passwords must the user provide before they can reuse an old password.
        ->The lockout threshold for incorrect password attempts and for how long the account will be locked.
        ->The minimum length of the password.
        ->The maximum age that passwords are allowed to reach indicating if passwords have to be rotated at a regular interval.

    This information can benefit us if we want to stage additional password spraying attacks against the other user accounts that we have now enumerated

No additional or external tooling is required, and these simple commands are often not monitored for by the Blue team.
The net commands must be executed from a domain-joined machine. If the machine is not domain-joined, it will default to the WORKGROUP domain.
The net commands may not show all information. For example, if a user is a member of more than ten groups, not all of these groups will be shown in the output.
