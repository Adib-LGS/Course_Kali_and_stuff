Clear-text files:

The following are some of the types of clear-text files that an attacker may be interested in:
    Commands history
    Configuration files (Web App, FTP files, etc.)
    Other Files related to Windows Applications (Internet Browsers, Email Clients, etc.)
    Backup files
    Shared files and folders
    Registry
    Source code 

As an example of a history command, a PowerShell saves executed PowerShell commands in a history file in a user profile in the following path: 
    C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt

The following command is to look for the "password" keyword in the Window registry:
    c:\Users\user> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
    #OR
    C:\Users\user> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s

ex: Using the "reg query" command, search for the value of the "flag" keyword in the Windows registry
    reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s | grep select-string "flag"

    Enumerate the AD environment we provided. What is the password of the victim user found in the description section:
        Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,SamAccountName,Description
