While you may be tempted to go to Active Directory Users and Computers to try and test Phillip's new powers, 
he doesn't really have the privileges to open it, so you'll have to use other methods to do password resets. 

In this case, we will be using Powershell to do so:
    Windows PowerShell (As Phillip)
    PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') -Verbose

    New Password: ENTER_NEW_PASSWORD_HERE

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set-ADAccountPassword" on target "CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local".
Since we wouldn't want Sophie to keep on using a password we know, 

we can also force a password reset at the next logon with the following command:
    Windows PowerShell (as Phillip)
    PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie -Verbose

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set" on target "CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local".
