Authentication Relays:

LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD
    Responder allows us to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks by poisoning the responses during NetNTLM authentication, 
    tricking the client into talking to you instead of the actual server they wanted to connect to. On a real LAN, Responder will attempt to poison any  Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR),  
    NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), and Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) requests that are detected

    On large Windows networks, these protocols allow hosts to perform their own local DNS resolution for all hosts on the same local network.


Intercepting NetNTLM Challenge:
    SMB Signing should either be disabled or enabled but not enforced. 
    When we perform a relay, we make minor changes to the request to pass it along. If SMB signing is enabled, we won't be able to forge the message signature, meaning the server would reject it.

    The associated account needs the relevant permissions on the server to access the requested resources. 
    Ideally, we are looking to relay the challenge and response of an account with administrative privileges over the server, 
    as this would allow us to gain a foothold on the host.

    Since we technically don't yet have an AD foothold, some guesswork is involved into what accounts will have permissions on which hosts. 
    If we had already breached AD, we could perform some initial enumeration first, which is usually the case.

CMD on Kali:
    sudo responder -I eth0 -dwP 

    When a LLMNR event occurs in the network and is maliciously responded to, the attacker will obtain sensitive information, including:
        The IP address of the victim (in this example: 10.0.3.7)
        The domain and username of the victim (in this example: MARVEL\fcastle)
        The victim’s password hash

    Cracking the Victim’s Hash
        hashcat –m 5600 <hashfile.txt> <wordlist.txt>
