Brute-force Login Attacks:
Since most AD environments have account lockout configured, we won't be able to run a full brute-force attack. 
Instead, we need to perform a password spraying attack. 

Instead of trying multiple different passwords, which may trigger the account lockout mechanism, we choose and use one password and attempt to authenticate with all the usernames we have acquired. 
However, it should be noted that these types of attacks can be detected due to the amount of failed authentication attempts they will generate.

Navigating to the URL, we can see that it prompts us for Windows Authentication credentials:
Userame + Password -> Use the Username collected after OSINT

We could use tools such as Hydra to assist with the password spraying attack. However, it is often better to script up these types of attacks yourself, 
which allows you more control over the process:
    Password_Spray_NTLM.py

    kali cmds:
        ->#python ntlm_passwordspray.py -u <userfile> -f <fqdn> -p <password> -a <attackurl>
