Relevant Penetration Testing Challenge:

######################################################################################

Scope of Work

The client requests that an engineer conducts an assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test).  The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:

    User.txt
    Root.txt

Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:

    Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement, however we ask that you attempt manual exploitation first
    Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
    Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
    Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope
    Find and report ALL vulnerabilities (yes, there is more than one path to root)

(Roleplay off)
I encourage you to approach this challenge as an actual penetration test. Consider writing a report, to include an executive summary, vulnerability and exploitation assessment, and remediation suggestions, as this will benefit you in preparation for the eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester or career as a penetration tester in the field.

Note - Nothing in this room requires Metasploit

Machine may take up to 5 minutes for all services to start.

**Writeups will not be accepted for this room.**
