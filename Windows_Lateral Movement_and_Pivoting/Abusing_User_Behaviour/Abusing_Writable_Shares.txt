Abusing Writable Shares:

RDP hijacking - Windows Server 2016 
When an administrator uses Remote Desktop to connect to a machine and closes the RDP client instead of logging off, 
his session will remain open on the server indefinitely. 
If you have SYSTEM privileges on Windows Server 2016 and earlier, you can take over any existing RDP session without requiring a password.

If we have administrator-level access, we can get SYSTEM by any method of our preference. 

For now, we will be using psexec to do so. First, let's run a cmd.exe as administrator:

Run as administrator on WINDOWS DEVICE
    ->PsExec64.exe(available at C:\tools\):
    ->PsExec64.exe -s cmd.exe


To list the existing sessions on a server, you can use the following command:
    ->C:\> query user
 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>administrator         rdp-tcp#6           2  Active          .  4/1/2022 4:09 AM
 luke                                    3  Disc            .  4/6/2022 6:51 AM

According to the command output above, if we were currently connected via RDP using the administrator user, our SESSIONNAME would be:
rdp-tcp#6. W

e can also see that a user named luke has left a session open with id 3. 
Any session with a "Disc" state has been left open by the user and isn't being used at the moment. 

To connect to a session, we will use tscon.exe and specify the session ID we will be taking over, as well as our current SESSIONNAME. 

Following command:
    ->tscon 3 /dest:rdp-tcp#6
    
In simple terms, the command states that the graphical session 3 owned by luke, should be connected with the RDP session rdp-tcp#6, owned by the administrator user.

As a result, we'll resume luke's RDP session and connect to it immediately.

Note: Windows Server 2019 won't allow you to connect to another user's session without knowing its password.
