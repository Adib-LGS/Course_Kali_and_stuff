Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:
-Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
-Checking job ads related to the target website.
-Reading news articles about the target company.

-whois to query WHOIS servers -> Query records

-nslookup to query DNS servers -> Query DNS

-dig to query DNS servers -> Query DNS

two online services:
These two online services allow us to:
Collect information about our target without directly connecting to it
->DNSDumpster
->Shodan.io

Whois:
WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43
The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names
-Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
-Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)
-Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
-Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?


Nslookup:
-nslookup -type=a google.com 8.8.8.8: return all the IPv4 addresses used by Google
-nslookup -type=MX google.com: return the email servers and configurations for a particular domain


Dig: (Same as Nslookup but with more Infos) !
-dig google.com MX: return more infos than Nslookup
-dig thmlabs.com TXT: return the TryHackMe Flag !


DNSDumpster.com: 
-Online service that offers detailed answers to DNS queries (sub domains etc...)
-DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. 
-DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.


Shodan.io:
-Helpful to learn various pieces of information about the client’s network, without actively connecting to it.
-One of the other most up voted searches is a search for MYSQL databases.
https://www.shodan.io/search?query=product%3AMySQL

-If we look at the search, we can see it is another filter.
product:MySQL

-Vuln filter, which let’s us search for IP addresses vulnerable to an exploit.
Let’s say we want to find IP addresses vulnerable to Eternal Blue:
vuln:ms17-010
